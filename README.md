# Assignment 5 CPSC350

Full Disclosure: We did not completely finish the assignment. We ran out of time before we could implement the following features:
* Constructing a BST from a filestream (deserialization)
* Rollback (see "rollback" branch; got pretty far in implementing a Stack to store BST copies on)
* Changing advisors/advisees of entries in the database
* Referential integrity

The majority of our issues stemmed from neither of us knowing how to properly and intentionally implement shallow/deep copy functionality in C++ going into the project. Lesson learned!
